# The Ordinary Layout, a familiar and powerful layout #

The Ordinary Layout is intended to be unremarkably mundane and remarkably useful. This layout maintains most key positions from common QWERTY keyboards, and it features enhanced Symbol and Media layers compared to the default Ergodox EZ layout.

I have been using this layout for many years, after so long decided to fork to allow me to remove a gaming keyboard and try playing with my ergodox, using only the left side.
