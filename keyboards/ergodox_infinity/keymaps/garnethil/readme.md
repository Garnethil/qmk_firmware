# Garnethi's Ordinary

Borrows from The Ordinary Layout, a familiar and powerful layout by Nicholas Keene ordinarylayout@nicholaskeene.com which I have used for many years, can't be more grateful.

This version of ordinary adds:

* Support for Ergodox Infinity LED and Visualizer
* A Dedicated Game Mode that flips only the thumbpad and adds F-keys to allowing playing videogames with only the left pad without having to remap spacebar and other keys every game.
